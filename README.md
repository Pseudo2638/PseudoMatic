This a Underdevelopment roject which would take attendance through the gps system and record it in database.
Note: The Database used in this code is an Online Hosting Database on Hostinger which makes hassle free transactions remotely with database.

Please Note that this project does not yet has a module for GPS and hence would be added in the future Commits on GIT.

This App can now check the database and see if the username and password exists in the database or not and if yes, then it fetches the 
linked intent and opens a new layout if Connection Succesfull Eles an Error message pops up.

This application is intented to check the credentials only and the comming code would be added later.
The User Interface Can be Modified as per requirements from the XML Layouts.
